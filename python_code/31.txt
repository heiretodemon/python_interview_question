We present an approach to efficiently detect the 2D pose
of multiple people in an image. The approach uses a nonparametric
representation, which we refer to as Part Affinity Fields PAFs,
to learn to associate body parts with individuals in the image. 
The architecture encodes global context, allowing a greedy 
bottom-up parsing step that maintains high accuracy while 
achieving realtime performance, irrespective of the number of 
people in the image.
